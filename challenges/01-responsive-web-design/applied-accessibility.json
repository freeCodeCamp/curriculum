Second, foreground and background colors need sufficient contrast so colorblind users can distinguish them.",

        "In practice, the 4.5:1 ratio can be reached by darkening the darker color and lightening the lighter one with the aid of a color contrast checker. Darker colors on the color wheel are considered to be blues, violets, magentas, and reds, whereas lighter colors are oranges, yellows, greens, and blue-greens.",

It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML source markup.

Here's an example:",
